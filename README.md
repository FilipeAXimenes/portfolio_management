# portfolio_management
Use of quadratic programming to reduce risk in a stock portfolio.  The stocks were defined based on the Yahoo Finance database, using subjective assumptions that were verified to be ideal.

Based on R's model of getting data, using the BatchGetSymbols library, using Python's particular libraries, without integrating with R, to model an ideal portfolio.

The code could be optimized, still making use of classic models like Markowitz 1952 and Black-Litterman.
